The goal of this code is to easily estimate readout noise contributions from DfMUX



Three classes are defined in the code- squid, wire, and dfmux_noise.
The squid object stores the transimpedance, dynamic impedance, input inductance and 
NEI of your SAA
The wire object stores the parasitic resistance, capacitance, and inductance of the wiring
harness linking the SAA and the 300K stages. It also can store information about
resistive or capcitive shunts across the SAA out pairs if they are present. This class
has methods which calculate various helpful transfer functions and effective resistances
of the harness at given frequences. 
The dfmux_noise object stores bolometer parameters, various important parasitic impedances,
and the temperature the cold stage is at, as well as an associated squid and wire object.
Lastly there is the option to specify a different wiring harness for the nuller lines
than the SAA out lines. (One is used for current sharing estimation and the other 
for SAA transfer function estimation.)
This class has methods which calculate the readout noise expected at given frequences. 
Measured current sharing can be given as an input to this method. There is also to an option
to estimate DAN off noise refered to the input of the SQUID Controller Board. This option
is only useful for in lab debuging, not scientific forcasting.

EXAMPLES
SA13 = squid(1000,750,3e-12,70e-9) #SA13 Zt, Zdyn, NEI, and Lin
wire = wire(30, 40e-12, 1e-6) #wiring harness resistance, capcitance, self inductance
bolo = bolo(1.0,0.2,10,0.25,0.5) #Bolometer operating resistance, stray resistance, loopgain, bath temp, Tc
parasitics = parasitics(stripline, c_gnd, r48) 
noise = dfmux_noise(SA13, wire, bolo, parasitics)
noise.init_freq(np.linspace(1e6,5e6,100) #evaluating noise between 1 and 5 MHz bias frequencies 

That produces noise estimates for a dfmux setup somewhat similar to SPT-3G/POLARBEAR 2
the noise object has properties such as CS, TF and noise broken down into its components to help identify causes
of noise for a given setup
